# Morphological Processing Task

This repository contains a Python implementation of morphological erosion and dilation applied to a collection of binary images.

## Description

The script takes a list of 2D binary arrays and applies either erosion or dilation using a square kernel. The process is parallelized using Python's `multiprocessing` module for performance. It also includes visualization using `matplotlib`.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

2. Run the script:

```
python morphology_task.py
```
